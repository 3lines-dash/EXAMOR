## Inspiration

> \*'For learners, one of the best habits should be regular self-testing' - **Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning\***

When I'm learning a new technology, I have the habit of taking notes and jotting down important information. It's a good habit, but I also have a bad habit of not enjoying reading the notes I've written (I'm not sure if this is the case for most people ðŸ«£). This results in my notes becoming mere mementos without substantial use. That's why I choose to create an application that continuously prompts you with questions to review your note contents.
